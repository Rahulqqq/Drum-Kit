# Drum-Kit

One section of my code which is all about detecting button press and then i have another part of my code which is all about detecting keyboard press. 
And if a button pressed and then i check the innerHTML of the button that got pressed and send that to makeSound in order to  play the relevant sound.
And if a keydown was detected instead then i send the event.key so the key property of the event. so when i press on the w button ,
Then it is makeSound (w), and they end up in here where we switch based on that key parameter and then we play the relevant sound depending on which key was passed in..
